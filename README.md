# writeviewer
WriteViewer is an accessibility tool for the visually impaired. The majority of videos on popular video hosting sites do not have an audio description, which would aid users who use screen readers. This resource will allow users to cooperatively add audio descriptions to videos.

All users are able to upload a video by copy and pasting the url (WriteViewer currently supports videos from YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, VK, and Wistia). Once it's online, any user can add an audio description for the use of a screen reader.

This project is still in its very early stages. Please feel free to email me at noahheinrich@gmail.com with any suggestions, particularly if you're experienced in engineering for accessibility.
